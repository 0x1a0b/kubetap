# Acknowledgements

## Mitmproxy

We give our thanks to the author and contributors of mitmproxy, in particular
[@cortesi](https://github.com/cortesi) and [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils).
Without their excellent work on mitmproxy, kubetap would not exist.

## @omrikiei & @vfreex

While we have not (yet) elected to integrate [ktunnel](https://github.com/omrikiei/ktunnel)
or create our own implementation, we are grateful that [omrikiei](https://github.com/omrikiei)
has taken on the task of creating a feature implementation until there is a native
implementation for [kubernetes/kubernetes#20227](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/20227).

We are also grateful to [@vfreex](https://github.com/vfreex) for his
[PR to resolve #20227 that remains unmerged](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57320).

## Early kubetap testers

We are grateful to the early kubetap testers who helped to ensure that kubetap
works in a variety of environments and configurations. Their feedback was crucial
and highly appreciated.
